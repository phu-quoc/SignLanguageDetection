# SignLanguageDetection
Sign Language Detection using Hog SVM from Scratch
In this project, we'll use Hog (Histogram of Gradient) to extract feature and then using SVM model for detection
🌟 Step 1: Define Hog and SVM
✍️ Step 2: In training.py, import Hog and SVM. Next, extract Hog feature, split to train and test datasets, using SVM to training and save in .pickle file
👏 Step 3: Load saved svm model, run open cv to get image for detection
